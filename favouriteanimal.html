   First of all, they are super loyalty to their
   host. Second, in my opinion, dogs are the
   cutest animal that alive on the earth. I have
   had a Husky when i was very young. Anytime, 
   when i got home, he could always recognize 
   that it was me and barking at the door. But 
   unfortunately, he was passed away about 3 years ago.
